## Status

Accepted

## Date

## Context

This ADR documents the decision to create a basic single page application for the col.beer domain. The basic webpage will return a simple Hello World style web page using React. The page should have very minimal styling and be able to be hosted as a single page application.

## Consequences

### Positive

- This creates a foundation on which to build a more advanced web page.

### Negative

- Reach may be overkill for a basic single page application.
